# AI-Project-Report

We built a new clustering algorithm which is fast and robust, to help finding a stratifying biliogical signatures and identify unique cell subpopulations within huge single-cell datasets belonging to melanoma patients' in late stage who undergone TIL/ACT trials. 
In addition to that, we built a classifier based on decision-trees which can predict if a future melanoma patient (in late stage) can pass TIL/ACT trails.
